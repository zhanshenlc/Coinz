\section{Project work plan}
\label{sec:work-plan}
\instructions{
Please provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan;
\item timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or similar);
\item detailed work description, i.e.:
\begin{itemize}
\item a description of each work package (table 3.1a);
\item a list of work packages (table 3.1b);
\item a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);
\end{itemize}
\item graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert chart or similar).
\end{itemize}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\indent Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. Include details of the resources to be allocated to each work package. The number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{You are advised to include a distinct work package on ``management'' (see section 3.2) and to give due visibility in the work plan to ``dissemination and exploitation'' and ``communication activities'', either with distinct tasks or distinct work packages.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) ``plan for the dissemination and exploitation of results'' in both the periodic and final reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken and those still planned. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data\footnote{Certain actions under Horizon 2020 participate in the ‘Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020’. All other actions can participate on a voluntary basis to this pilot.  Further guidance is available in the H2020 Online Manual on the Participant Portal.}, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\noindent \textbf{Definitions:}}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\ul{``Work package''} means a major sub-division of the proposed project.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\ul{``Deliverable''} means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project's overall objectives and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\ul{``Milestones''} means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.}
\vskip0.2cm
\emph{\noindent Report on work progress is done primarily through the periodic and final reports. Deliverables should complement these reports and should be kept to the minimum necessary.}

\section{Consortium as a whole} 
\label{sec:consortium}
\instructions{
\emph{The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together? 
\item If applicable, describe how the project benefits from any industrial/SME involvement.
\item \textbf{Other countries:} If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project.
